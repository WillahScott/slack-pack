## Summary

The tool we are setting out to create will help navigate through the vast amount of activity that occurs through Slack by **clustering and summarizing conversations** so that users can easily get up to speed of all the topics that have been discussed and only review the messages of those he is interested in.


## Statement

Slack contains a lot of information, some of it is known, using keyword filters or the search function. In other cases, it’s useful information that you didn’t previously know you were interested in. If you have been away from your channel for a while, uncovering this information can be time consuming or impossible. This leads the problem of ‘Slack Anxiety’ or the feeling of anxiousness you get when you haven’t been regularly checking in on your slack channels. Our tool proposes to make the experience of Filtering and Highlighting information while you were away more user friendly. The goal of the project is to group information into conversations with topics. This feature is both useful for channels you are very active in -‘getting up to date’ - as well as popping in to channels you infrequently use, getting a summary of ‘what’s been going on lately’.

I would suggest reading this chapter prior to delving into the details of designing and conducting the experiment. I believe this would be most helpful, ensuring that we cross our eyes and dot our tees. :simple_smile:"1466978503	9	Invite received! I think editing works.1466978513	10	"<@U15T45XQS>:  and to everyone else, I'm sharing a To-do list from Google Sheets for our Experiment project. Feel free to review and add comments. I have set up that access at this link. <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rGyNIHcFUlS3johVJYtXjRPaq0gq8Uzhe6U8C3edTiw/edit?usp=sharing>  As a review, Minhchau and I are investigating the effects of personality detail (high and low) versus reading recall. The null hypothesis states that high detail people perform better on memory recall from readings task better than low detail people.."1466978651	11	"To make it sound slightly more like a null hypothesis, we're attempting to reject the hypothesis that providing a reading guide to people has the same benefit to high detail people as it does to low detail people. Of course, we're not exactly sure how big our sample size needs to be in order to properly reject that null hypothesis."1466978696	12	<@U17BYEAF2>:  Thanks for clarifying that 'detail'. :simple_smile:1466978749	3	If anyone has not picked a research team and are interested in turning the pedagogical world upside down let us know. More people should equate to a larger sample size.1466978829	11	"On the note of sample sizes! In the readings we've had so far, it seemed like they had a vague notion of standard deviation before they were able to compute what sample size they needed for the power they wanted. <@U15T45XQS> or anyone who might know, are we expected to estimate how big our sample size needs to be in order to properly reject the null, or are we going to wind up finding out just how much power we wound up with *after* the experiment? Because I'm not sure how you'd estimate that without so much as a guess on the population variance."1466985060	11	<@U17BYEAF2>: you're right on the money with that concern. Another concern is the size of the treatment effect. I don't have any _ex ante_ expectations about how far you're going to move the needle. 1466985246	11	"There are two ways I work with this: (a) before having any data, create a schedule with scenarios (conservative, normative, aggressive) corresponding to effect size and variance, calculate power as `f(n)`. Then, after running a pilot, (b) updating my beliefs with the data I collected. "1466985312	11	"The idea here is that if you make a guess and realize that it would take 10,000 and you only have cash enough for 1,000 you stop and redesign.

I particularly liked hearing students explain concepts from their perspective. <@U15T45XQS> Next time, feel free to step up on the running machine during office hours.

If we can do that then I will approach our HR director and obtain permission to utilize company employees as test subjects. I believe I can make the pitch. Do you have access to groups of people that you could meet with in person?1467218756	17	<@U17DGAWDR> &amp; <@U17BYEAF2> would you guys take this conversation into a direct message channel? This will minimize the crossfire for everyone else. Thanks!1467220892	17	"<@U15T45XQS>: I was thinking it'd be good to have the conversation in general encourage some more conversation about the experiments everyone else is doing to see if we can learn from each other from conversation, but if that's not actually useful, we can go to direct message. :slightly_smiling_face:"1467651179	18	"<@U15T45XQS>: Does this example satisfy the randomization requirement for an experiment? We create a list of 1:100 slots. We randomly assign slots as control or treatment. Then when subjects arrive, starting with slot one, they get assigned to the next available slot."1467677159	19	"I remember reading something about experimental designs where they use a company's internal userId modulo 2 to decide treatment vs. control for 50/50 splits. From that, I'm thinking that even if it's pre-determined, as long as the selection is not dependent on a user attribute that is correlated with the outcome or with the other model variables, I think it satisfies the randomization requirement."1467677843	20	In W203 there was a regression problem where the gender of the subject's first born child determined control vs treated.

It is as though you line people up outside your laboratory, and toss coins inside. Since the subjects dont know the results of the toss, they cant sort on it. I would be certain to check that there are not systematic differences though, just to make sure.
